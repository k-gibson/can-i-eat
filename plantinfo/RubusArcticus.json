    "name": "Arctic Raspberry",
    "edibleDescription": "Arctic raspberries do not store well fresh because the stalk doesnâ€™t separate from the berry in such a way that it could be stored intact. Traditionally these berries are made into jam, juice and nectar. They can also be used as a base for wines or liqueurs. Berries can be eaten fresh or baked. Fresh or dried leaves and flowers can be used as a tea or tossed into a salad.",
