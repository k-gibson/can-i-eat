    "edibleDescription": "The leaves and stalks are edible. Use stems in salads, or raw; leaves in soups, stews, and teas. They have a liquorice-like flavour, and can be used as a flavouring in mixed salads. Stalks (younger) and young shoots can be consumed cooked or raw (but should be peeled). They can be used like celery once boiled. A tea can be made from the leaves, seed or roots. Angelica pairs well with fennel.",
