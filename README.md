# Can I Eat This?

The purpose of this project is to retrieve edibility of plant species from pictures. Edibility is determined via different parts of each plant ( flowers, fruits, bark, roots, etc).

### Utilizes

Plant Identification: https://web.plant.id/plant-identification-api/
Edible foods database: https://fms.cmsvr.com/fmi/webd/Food_Plants_World

## Necessary Disclaimer

This project only determines potential edibility of plant species and is just a for-joy project. Errors in identifiaction may occur, especially with our fungus friends. Please think before you eat; insects, bacteria, and viruses are abound!
